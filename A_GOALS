So the program should run a trading loop using a classification ML algo to trade. An LLM (ollama)
should manage the entire program where the program would benefit from it.

As it trades it should log what it does for review later.
When program starts theres 4 options, live trading, train ml, test indicators, llm review

Testing indicators should be testing 2 indicators together and if they score .45 then test 3 indicators together,
if these score well enough then test 4.

As for llm review the idea is the llm should evaluate the entire program, all files, all config data
all numbers and it c an be really slow but thats fine.

everything in the program should have a progress bar indicator if it takes more than 5 seconds to complete.
